# CSC2001F : BinarySearchTree
Comparison of the Binary Search Tree with a normal data structure such as an array.

AccessArrayApp is a Java based application that reads in a text file, and stores them in a traditional array. The text file used was a text file with random names aswell as their associated student numbers. 

AccessBSTApp has the same purpose as the above application, but instead of using a traditional array for storage, it used the more advantagous Binary Search Tree Structure.

Both approaches were compared in terms of complexity (comparatory operations), it was seen that the AccessBSTApp approach was superior with significantly less comparisons and thus more effecient.
